# ðŸš€ Quick System Designer - One Click Solution

## New Feature Added to Dashboard

### Overview
A powerful "one-click" system sizing wizard has been added to the **Dashboard** tab, right after the customer information section. This allows you to quickly design a complete solar system by simply entering monthly kWh usage.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Enter Customer Information
- Fill in customer details (name and phone are required)
- Save the information

### Step 2: Use Quick System Designer
After saving customer info, you'll see the **Quick System Designer** section with:

#### Input Fields:
1. **Monthly kWh Usage** (50 - 10,000 kWh)
   - Enter the customer's average monthly electricity consumption
   - Can be found on their electricity bill

2. **System Type** (3 options)
   - **Hybrid (Grid + Battery)** - Best for most homes, provides backup power
   - **On-Grid (No Battery)** - Lowest cost, no backup during outages
   - **Off-Grid (Full Battery)** - Complete independence from the grid

### Step 3: Calculate System
Click **"âš¡ Calculate System"** button and instantly get:

## Smart Calculations

### System Sizing Logic:
- **PV Capacity**: Based on daily usage Ã· sunlight hours Ã— 1.25 (safety margin)
- **Battery Capacity**:
  - Hybrid: 70% of daily usage (night coverage)
  - Off-Grid: 200% of daily usage (2 days autonomy)
  - On-Grid: 0 (no battery)
- **Inverter Size**: Peak load estimate (3Ã— average) Ã— 1.25 (margin)

### Product Selection:
- Uses **actual products** from your `product_prices.txt`
- Finds **best value** products matching requirements
- Falls back to generic estimates if specific products unavailable
