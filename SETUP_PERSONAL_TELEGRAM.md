---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### **Step 1: Get Your API Credentials**

1. **Open:** https://my.telegram.org
2. **Login** with your phone number
3. **Click:** "API development tools"
4. **Create app:**
   - App title: `KHSolar`
   - Short name: `khsolar`
   - Platform: `Desktop`
5. **Copy:**
   - `api_id` (numbers like: 12345678)
   - `api_hash` (string like: abc123def456...)

---

### **Step 2: Install Library**

```bash
pip install telethon
```

---

### **Step 3: Add Credentials to .env**

Open/create `.env` file and add:

```env
# Your Telegram API credentials
TELEGRAM_API_ID=12345678
TELEGRAM_API_HASH=abc123def456...
TELEGRAM_PHONE=+855123456789
```

**Replace with:**
- Your actual `api_id`
- Your actual `api_hash`
- Your phone number (with country code)

---

### **Step 4: First Time Login**

```bash
python telegram_personal_sender.py
```

**What happens:**
1. You'll receive a code on Telegram
2. Enter the code
3. (If 2FA enabled) Enter password
4. Done! Session saved

**You only do this ONCE!**

---

## 📱 How It Works

### **From App:**
1. Customer enters their Telegram username
2. You click "📤 Send Report to My Telegram"
3. Report sent **from your account** to customer!

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Send to **anyone** (username or phone)
- ✅ No registration needed from customer
- ✅ Shows as personal message from you
- ✅ More trustworthy
- ✅ Can see delivery status

## 🎯 Comparison

### **Bot Method:**
```
Customer → Must click /start first
         → Register with bot
         → Wait for report
         → Feels automated
```

### **Personal Account Method:**
```
You → Click send
    → Instantly delivered
    → Customer receives immediately
    → Feels personal
```

---

## 🔧 Integration with App

I'll update your `app.py` to use this method. It will:

1. Check if personal sender is configured
2. If yes: Use personal sender
3. If no: Fall back to bot method
4. Show clear status messages

---

## 💡 Usage Examples

### **Send to Username:**
```python
recipient = "chhanycls"  # or "@chhanycls"
success, msg = send_report_from_personal(recipient, report_data, "bilingual")
```

### **Send to Phone Number:**
```python
recipient = "+855123456789"
success, msg = send_report_from_personal(recipient, report_data, "english")
```

### **Automatic Detection:**
- If starts with `@` or no `+` → Treated as username
- If starts with `+` → Treated as phone number

---

## 🔐 Security

### **Session File:**
- Creates `khsolar_session.session` file
- Contains your login session
- **Keep this file safe!**
- Don't share or commit to git

### **Credentials:**
- Stored in `.env` file
- Never committed to version control
- Your `api_id` and `api_hash` are personal

---

## 🧪 Test It

### **Command Line Test:**
```bash
python telegram_personal_sender.py
```

**You'll be asked:**
1. Recipient (username or phone)
2. Language choice (1/2/3)
3. Sends test report!

### **Check Telegram:**
- Open your Telegram
- Go to the conversation
- You'll see the message you sent!

---

## ⚙️ Advanced Options

### **Send to Multiple People:**
```python
recipients = ["@user1", "+855123456789", "@user3"]
for recipient in recipients:
    send_report_from_personal(recipient, report_data, "bilingual")
```

### **Check Delivery:**
```python
sender = PersonalTelegramSender()
sender.connect()
success, msg = sender.send_report("@username", report_data)
if success:
    print("Delivered!")
sender.disconnect()
```
