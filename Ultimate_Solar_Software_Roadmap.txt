Ultimate Solar Planning & Business Software Roadmap (Final Enhanced Version)

1. Software Goal
- Plan, simulate, and optimize hybrid solar systems for homes.
- Support Khmer household usage patterns, realistic device usage, and night/day simulation.
- Include business/product management, cost calculation, and ROI analysis.
- Provide interactive, AI-driven recommendations, real-time monitoring, and reporting.

2. Input Module (Multiple Options)
- Device-based: name, power (W), daily usage hours.
- Monthly usage: total kWh/month → converts to daily average.
- System specifications: PV panels, inverter, battery capacity.
- Hybrid input: any combination of above.
- Location: sunlight hours adjustment.
- Optional: historical electricity data for AI prediction.

3. Product & Cost Management (Business Feature)
- Add products (PV, inverter, battery, smart devices).
- Enter cost, warranty, supplier info.
- Calculate total system cost, ROI, payback period.
- Compare different product combinations.
- Generate quotes/proposals for customers.
- Multi-currency and bulk pricing support.

4. Calculation Modules
- PV Array Sizing: based on load and sunlight hours.
- Battery Sizing: based on night load and desired autonomy.
- Load Analysis: total daily energy, day/night split, priority devices.
- Financial Calculation: cost, ROI, payback, subsidies or incentives.

5. Hourly Simulation Module
- PV → load → battery → grid energy flow per hour.
- Battery state-of-charge (SoC) tracking.
- Sunlight curve adjustment for seasonal/monthly variation.
- Energy surplus/deficit prediction.
- Scenario simulation for new devices or system specs.

6. Device Scheduling & Advice Module
- Optimal device running hours recommended.
- AI-based energy efficiency recommendations.
- Alerts if load exceeds PV/battery capacity.
- User override and scenario simulation.
- Priority devices: essential vs optional.
- Scenario management: save and compare multiple device schedules.

7. Visualization & Reporting
- Daily/weekly/monthly summary: PV production, load, battery, grid usage.
- 24-hour graphs: energy flow visualization.
- Device usage table & schedule recommendations.
- 3D PV layout for roof installation planning.
- Export: PDF, Excel, CSV, printable device schedules.
- ROI and payback visualization charts.

8. Rich / Advanced Features
- AI-based load prediction & adaptive advice.
- Smart device/IoT integration for automatic load balancing.
- Real-time monitoring of PV and battery.
- Weather forecast integration for solar generation prediction.
- Maintenance and lifecycle tracking for PV, inverter, battery.

- Educational mode: explain energy savings, solar principles, environmental impact.

9. User Interface & Interaction
- Modern dashboard with summary widgets (PV output, battery SoC, current load, savings).
- Drag-and-drop device scheduling with tooltips.
- Interactive 24-hour timeline (battery, PV, load).
- Color-coded alerts: red (deficit), yellow (battery low), green (PV sufficient).
- Dark/light mode.
- Mobile-friendly responsive design.
- Multi-language support (Khmer/English).
