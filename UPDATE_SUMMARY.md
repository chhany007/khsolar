# Product Catalog Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the KHSolar application to use **only products from `product_prices.txt`** instead of hardcoded products.

## Changes Made

### 1. Product Manager (`product_manager.py`)
- ‚úÖ Added automatic parsing of `product_prices.txt`
- ‚úÖ Intelligent categorization of products into:
  - **PV Panels** (10 products): Lvtopsun, LONGi panels
  - **Inverters** (28 products): Sungrow, Solis, Deye, Luxpower, LV
  - **Batteries** (4 products): LV Gel batteries, DEYE lithium, LVtopsun lithium
  - **Monitoring** (5 products): Smart meters, WiFi modules
  - **Pumps** (10 products): DC solar pumps
  - **Cables** (2 products): PV cables
  - **Mounting** (5 products): Rails, clamps, connectors
  - **Accessories** (1 product): Off-grid equipment
- ‚úÖ Added helper methods:
  - `get_recommended_panel(min_wattage)` - Find best value panel
  - `get_recommended_battery(min_capacity_kwh)` - Find suitable battery
  - `get_recommended_inverter(min_power_kw, inverter_type)` - Find matching inverter
- ‚úÖ Automatic specification extraction (wattage, voltage, capacity, etc.)

### 2. Main Application (`app.py`)
- ‚úÖ **System Configuration Page**: Now uses actual products from catalog as defaults
  - Solar panel defaults to Lvtopsun 550W @ $66.00
  - Battery defaults to DEYE 100AH 51.2v @ $1440.00
  - Inverter defaults to Deye Hybrid 5kw @ $888.00
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Fill Feature**: Pulls recommended products based on your load requirements
- ‚úÖ **Smart Recommendations**: System suggests best value products for your system size
- ‚úÖ **Products Page**: Enhanced display showing:
  - Category filtering
  - Product specifications
  - Wholesale prices
  - Customer prices with 30% markup
  - Warranty information

### 3. Pricing System
- ‚úÖ All prices now come from `product_prices.txt` (wholesale)
- ‚úÖ Customer reports automatically apply 30% markup (as per existing system)
- ‚úÖ Labor costs: $250 (‚â§5kW) or $500 (>5kW)
- ‚úÖ Support materials: $450-$600 based on system size

## Products Loaded (65 Total)

### Solar Panels (10)
- Lvtopsun 340W, 550W, 620W
- LONGi Panel 360w, 585w

### Inverters (28)
- Sungrow: SG33CX-P2 to 250KW
- Solis: 5kw to 40kw Ongrid
- Deye: 5kw to 50kw Hybrid & On-grid
- Luxpower: 6kw
- LV: 3kw, 5kw, 11kw Off-grid

### Batteries (4)
- LV Gel: 100AH to 250AH 12V
- DEYE: 100AH 51.2v (5.12KWH)
- LVtopsun: 51.2V 100-300AH Lithium
- Battery controllers and racks

### Additional Components
- Smart meters (COM100E, Weidmuller, Acrel, WiFi modules)
- DC Solar pumps (600W to 4000W)
- PV cables (4mm, 6mm)
- Mounting hardware (rails, clamps, connectors)

## How It Works

1. **Startup**: App automatically loads all products from `product_prices.txt`
2. **Smart Parsing**: Each product is analyzed and categorized with extracted specs
3. **Recommendations**: System finds best value products matching your requirements
4. **Configuration**: Users can accept recommendations or manually select from catalog
5. **Reports**: All pricing uses actual wholesale costs with optional 30% customer markup

## Testing Results
‚úÖ Successfully loaded 65 products
‚úÖ All categories properly recognized
‚úÖ Recommendation methods working correctly
‚úÖ Prices match your product_prices.txt file

## Benefits
- üìù **Single source of truth**: Update prices in one file
- üí∞ **Accurate pricing**: Always uses your current wholesale prices
- ü§ñ **Smart recommendations**: Best value products for each system
- üìä **Complete catalog**: All 65 products available in system
- üîÑ **Easy maintenance**: Just update product_prices.txt to add/change products

## Next Steps (Optional)
If you need to add new products:
1. Add them to `product_prices.txt` in format: `Product Name: $Price`
2. Restart the application
3. Products will be automatically categorized and available

## Files Modified
- ‚úÖ `product_manager.py` - Complete rewrite of product loading
- ‚úÖ `app.py` - Updated to use product catalog throughout
- ‚úÖ `test_products.py` - Test script to verify loading (can be deleted)

---
**Note**: The system remembers that wholesale prices are used for internal calculations, and customer reports apply the 30% markup automatically as configured in your Reports page.
